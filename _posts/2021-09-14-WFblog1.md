## Introduction - Pre-requisite Software

**NOTE:** I assume here that you have access to a GitHub account and have already created a repository.

In order to expedite and simplify the process of commiting and pushing changes to one's GitHub repository, I discovered that making use of Visual Studio Code's _source control_ feature was indispensible to saving me time and effort. It is relatively painless to set up, too! 

The following are the pre-requisite software downloads: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Git Extensions](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [Visual Studios Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) must all be downloaded before you can begin saving time committing changes and pushing them onto your GitHub website. For our purposes, default settings for all of these pieces of software will be more than sufficient. Skip right on through those setup wizards!

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

Now that you have all of the dependencies, let's move on to retrieving your GitHub repository from GitHub itself. We will start by visiting GitHub's website. From there, open the repository you wish to use with VS Code. Click the green "Code" button as seen below, followed by _Open with GitHub Desktop_. ![GitHub site](/assets/img/githubrepo.png)

This is where the GitHub Desktop app that you installed earlier comes into play.
