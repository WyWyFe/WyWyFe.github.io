# Creating Dynamic Backdrops Using JS 

**Before we begin:** this post relies on information covered in the previous blog, so [click here](https://wywyfe.github.io/2021-10-27-WFblog7/) if you want a brief intro to see what kind of filesystem we're working with!

Here's a small update on what I have changed since the last ReactJS blog post. I implemented a CSS file to further style the web page like so: ![css1]() ![css2]()

You may notice somehting in the file explorer pane - two new components called Backdrop.js and Modal.js. (and of course the index.css style file in SRC, but that is showcased in the above picture.) Notice we make frequent use of JS's className feature.

These new files are what we will be using to deal with this concept of state. Ever clicked an element on a website and have a popup that you can't click away from suddenly appear? That is essentially a concept of state. At any given time, your website may need to display overlays over your website (a Modal). Let's take a look at the structure of my Modal.js file. Keep in mind, this will be rendered by the browser - consider it just another component we can plug into App.js. ![modal.js]()

This Modal.js file is essentially a basic template presenting the user with the option to continue with whatever action prompted the modal to pop up (i.e you call Modal.js in the app.js file), or to "exit out"

In either case, we need the backdrop to appear to make it clear that the screen behind the Modal popup is unreachable, but we only want the modal to pop up if we click the prompt button.
