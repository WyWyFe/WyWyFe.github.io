## Introduction - Why Copy a Docker Container?

For today's blog, I will explain the utility of copying an existing docker container into an image for later use.
Let's say that you have a pre-existing docker container that you assigned port forwardings to in the past. Let's also say, for argument's sake, that you want to keep that pre-existing container the way it is, but you want to make another instance of that container that has additional forwarded (is that a word?) ports for future use. This guide is for you.

## Using _Docker Commit_ to Create an Image

To start off, let's begin by stating an important fact: the only time in a docker container's lifespan in which you can forward ports is with the use of the **_docker run_** command. Commands such as **docker start** cannot use the _-p_ option in order to add additional ports. 

To circumvent this issue, we must use the _commit_ docker command to _create a new image from a container's changes._ (from the words of **docker help commit** itself)
In order to see the containers (whether they are running or not), use the Docker command _docker ps -a,_ as shown below. ![docker ps -a](/assets/img/blog2pic1.png)

Following this, we need to _commit_ the container. For our example, we will use the _simple-prometheus_ container pictured above. The syntax will be _docker commit name-of-original name-of-new_ as pictured below. ![docker commit](/assets/img/blog2pic2.png)

## Creating a New Container from an Image

Now that we have an image of the original container _simple-prometheus,_ we can use that image to create a brand new container using the same old _run_ command we all know and love, this time with the port we wanted to forward. We will forward port 3060 on the new container. ![testcon1](/assets/img/blog2pic3.png)

To verify that the container has been properly run, we will run a standard _docker ps -a_ and look at our images. Sure enough, _testcon1_ is present! ![testcon](/assets/img/blog2pic4.png)

And that's it! If neccessary, you can stop the previously running container by using _docker stop container-name-here._ Happy port forwarding~
