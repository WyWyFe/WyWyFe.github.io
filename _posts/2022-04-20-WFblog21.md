# Introduction - A Case for Manipulating an Array's Contents

Let's say you have an array with set values you want to be able to check for spelling errors. The array looks like this:

```
var sentenceArray = new Array(); //declare new array object sentenceArray to individually store sentences. can't do that at array initialization.
sentenceArray[0] = "Much did had call new drew that kept. Limits expect wonder law she. Now has you views woman noisy match money rooms.";
sentenceArray[1] = "To up remark it eldest length oh passed. Off because yet mistake feeling has men.";
sentenceArray[2] = "Consulted disposing to moonlight ye extremity.";
sentenceArray[3] = "Engage piqued in on coming.";
sentenceArray[4] = "Text to test here. Click Change Test Text to change the text you wish to test your speed against.";
```

and you want the contents of the array to be split into individual characters so you can run a spellcheck to see if a user is typing the contents correctly. To accomplish this you would need to use the JavaScript **split** function (alongside **forEach**) to split the contents of sentenceArray into individual characters, and after, you would need to re-insert them into whatever display element you have in your HTML. For ease of reference (and so we don't have to keep typing it repeatedly), I have created a constant called testText that uses the document method querySelector to target an ID in my HTML block called changeThisText. Here's what that looks like:

```
const testText = document.querySelector("#changeThisText");
```
